# Notes-In-Clouds
![{data.license}](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description
    
This Note saving application will save and delete notes from a JSON file, all from the cloud! Which means that your notes will still be there, even after closing the browser.

The backend code was built to connect with the frontend starter code. HTML routes are setup to return the index and notes files, while dynamically updating its database.
